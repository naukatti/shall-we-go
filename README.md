# Timetable infoscreen

This is a projet I did for a Summer Job challenge.

This project was built using `create-react-app`

## What it does

It is an app that uses HSL graphql opendata api to get different public transportation routes between home and work.
This app is hosted on Fly.io, available at timetable.naukatti.com.
 
It shows 7 different routes at a time and updates the when you refresh the app.

## Technical stuff

## How to use

- Local development environment can be set up with `npm install` and `npm start`
- A docker container can be launched with `docker-compose up`

# Ideas for improvement

- Responsivity
- Accessibility
- Some basic tests
- Dark theme
- The start and end location could be changed from the app
