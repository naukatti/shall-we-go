# Timetable infoscreen

This is a projet I did for Eficode's Summer Job challenge.

This project was built using `create-react-app`

## What it does

 It is an app that uses HSL graphql opendata api to get different public transportation routes between home and Eficode.
 This app is hosted on heroku, available at timetable.naukatti.com. Heroku was chosen over other cloud providers, because it was the easiest to use, quickest to implement and suited the needs of this project.
 
 It shows 7 different routes at a time and updates the when you refresh the app.
